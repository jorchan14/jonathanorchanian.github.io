    <H1> Baseball </H1>
I had a pretty great baseball journey. I played this sport my whole entire life, and loved it so much. I was on the all star team every single year for in town baseball. I loved this sport the most. When it came to high school I had such a great freshman year that I was asked to practice with the varsity. The next year I made the team and had secured a starting position in right field. I had a great season and the next year I moved to center field and batted .400. The year after I was named captain and our team made it very deep in the playoffs but unfortunately lost.
