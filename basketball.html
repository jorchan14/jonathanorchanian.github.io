    <H1> Basketball </H1>
I love basketball. My father would teach me how to play ever since I was in diapers. In elementary school I would play with the older kids. When I got to middle school I made the A team. When high school hit I made the freshman team and loved every second of it. The next year I made the team and found myself coming off of the bench for the majority of the games, but I also had a few starts. The next year I started most of the games and we had an alright season. Then the year later my best friends and I quit because we hated the coach. I still play basketball recreationally.
