    <H1> Football </H1>
My football journey is a simple one. I was hesitant to play the sport throughout elementary and middle school because I was very busy and a tad bit frightened. My middle school gym teacher told me that if I played, my life would be a whole lot more exciting. So I decided to play freshman year. I caught plenty of passes on offense, made plenty of plays on defense, and recorded 5 touchdowns on the year. Also, me and 5 others were asked to practice with the varsity at the end of the year. The next year I earned a spot on our high school varsity special teams. This earned me my very first varsity letter. The next year I took the role of starting cornerback and receiver and had another very succesful year. The next year I had earned the right as one of 5 captains of our team. I played extremely well, as we finished the season 8-3, going undefeated at home.
